Problem Definition:
    Given a complete weighted graph, what is the shortest path which visits
    every node and ends where it starts

Input:
    Weighted adjacency lists in the following format:
    n (number of nodes)
    u v w (u: outgoing node, v: incoming node, w: weight)
    Examples:
        3
        A B 3
        B C 2
        C A 1
