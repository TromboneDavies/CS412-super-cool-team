    # concept: ant colony optimization (ACO)
    #  FOR EACH ANT:
    #   1. probabalisticaly select an edge based on the weight and pheromone levels
    #   2. travel to that path, adding pheromones to the edge
    #      - traveling down a path takes time, so an ant might be skipped in a round
    #        due to it traveling to a node during that time
    #   3. repeat until no more nodes are possible, and return home
    # place ants randomly and allow them to follow this structure. decrease pheromones slightly
    # for each round.
    
    # questions:
    #  - where do ants start? randomly, or multiple ants at one starging node?
